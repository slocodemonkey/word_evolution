Word Evolution

This ap written by Matt West aka slocodemonkey

Word Evolution takes a 50 character user input, and then evolves a match to that word or phrase starting with a set of 12 randomized "seeds" (text-strings) and then selecting and interbreeding them via an algorithm.  

This application is free use, and can be used, copied, linked to or modified without restriction.  

It would be kind of cool if you gave me credit for writing the program.   

If you make something great out of my little ap I would love to hear about it so I can go check it out.
